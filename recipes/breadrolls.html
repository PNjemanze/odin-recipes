        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hawaiian bread rolls that will be the star of family dinner. Serves 12.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li> 
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon molasses</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry milk powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter flavored shortening</li>
            <li>4½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order 
                recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle for a 2 pound batch; 
                press Start. The dough can be a bit sticky, so you may want to add a 
                little bit more bread flour as it mixes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the dough cycle is complete, turn the risen dough out on a lightly 
                floured surface and divide into twelve equal pieces. Form the pieces into 
                rounds and place on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a 
                damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. 
                Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
